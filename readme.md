The aim of this project is to reveal the effectiveness of two different user interface designs (version A and version B) in improving user engagement and efficiency. We wanted to address the question of whether one design was significantly better than the other in terms of user interaction metrics such as misclicks, time on page, and time to first click.  By presenting the designs to a sample of users and collecting data on their interactions, A/B testing with statistical analysis allowed us to isolate the impact of the design changes.
