Behind this seamless experience is often a process called A/B testing, where designers compare two versions of the page against each other to determine which one performs better.</div>
                    <div class="small-paragraph-space"></div>
                    <div class="small-content-style">The aim of this project is to reveal the effectiveness of two different user interface designs (version A and version B) in improving user engagement and efficiency. We wanted to address the question of whether one design was significantly better than the other in terms of user interaction metrics such as misclicks, time on page, and time to first click.  By presenting the designs to a sample of users and collecting data on their interactions, A/B testing with statistical analysis allowed us to isolate the impact of the design changes.</div>

                        (Right below) is the interface after we have modified it. Though a traditional A/B test randomly assigns users to either version A or version B, this will allow us to collect enough data for the later parts.</div>

The hypothesis was simple: could changing the color of a button or adjusting the spacing between lines of text make a noticeable difference in user experience? Analyzing misclick rates, time for first click,  and time spent on the page, we discovered the effect design elements have on user behavior. In general, we hypothesized that version B, with its intuitive design, would outperform version A.</div>
